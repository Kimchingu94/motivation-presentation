	    <p><strong>A little bit of my thoughts while making this : </strong> 
		<br />As a 19 year old I always thought things will always go well for me as soon as i enter University and thought i'd start making great things and helping my community immediately. 
		<br /> But in reality I was just an 18 year old who moved out to become independent but is strugling with independencey.
		<br />All my life I've alway wanted to achive things on my own and never learned to ask for help, even turning down help because i didn't want to bother anyone.
		<br />I'm always helpful and trying to help anyone at my capacity. Writing down what motivates me helped me realise that <b>HELP</b> is my biggest strength , motivation and my weakness. 
		<br />Because I help others since that's what motivates me by seeing people realived or happy because they feel better after struggling with something; It makes it my strength. 
		<br />Not asking for <b> HELP</b> is my weakness because I usually regret not asking for help when i really needed it.
        <br />Since I started year up I've learnd out to ask for help more from the staff especially.</p>
      
    	<section><p><strong>Motivation</strong> I'm so excited to be in yearup and enjoy the connections and different skills and personality in my LC. 
		<br /> Right now one of my biggest motivation is you all even though i didnt add that in my video. 
		<br /> I'm always looking forward to the days we meet in person since its the only time i dont have to just sit in front of a computer all day alone.</p><section>
